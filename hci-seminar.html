 		<strong>Abstract:</strong>
 		<p style="padding-bottom:10px">
		Computer-mediated communication (CMC) tools and social media potentially allow people to interact fluidly across national, cultural and linguistic boundaries in ways that would have been difficult if not impossible in the past. To date, however, however, much of this potential fails to be realized. A single individual is unlikely to be fluent in a wide array of languages. The use of a lingua franca such as English permits a degree of interaction with speakers of other native languages, but it can have negative effects on non-native speakers. Advances in machine translation (MT) and other technologies could allow people to communicate with one another in their native language, but translation errors can create sizeable misunderstandings when MT is used in conversational settings. 

		In a series of studies, Prof. Fussell's students and her have been exploring the problem space of inter-lingual communication, with the goals of better understanding the challenges of interaction across language boundaries and of informing the design of new tools to support this interaction.  Prof.Fussell will first describe two interview studies exploring how the need to use a non-native language affects communication and coordination in both formal and informal settings. She will then describe several tools we have developed to make MT more usable in everyday conversation and present the results of lab studies evaluating these tools.  Taken together, these studies help help advance the area of inter-lingual computer-mediated communication.

 		<strong>Abstract:</strong>
 		<p style="padding-bottom:10px">
		Despite the continued development of individual technologies and processes for supporting human endeavors, major leaps in solving complex human problems will require advances in system-level thinking and orchestration. In this talk, I describe efforts to design, build, and study Computational Ecosystems that interweave community process, social structures, and intelligent systems to unite people and machines to solve complex problems and advance human values at scale. Computational ecosystems integrate various components to support ecosystem function; the interplay among components synergistically advances desired values and problem solving goals in ways that isolated technologies and processes cannot. Taking a systems approach to design, computational ecosystems emphasize (1) computational thinking to decompose and distribute problem solving to diverse people or machines most able to address them; and (2) ecological thinking to create sustainable processes and interactions that support jointly the goals of ecosystem members and proper ecosystem function.
		</br>
		I present examples of computational ecosystems designed to advance community-based planning and research training, that respectively engages thousands of people in planning an event and empowers a single faculty member to provide authentic research training to 20+ students. These solutions demonstrate how to combine wedges of human and machine competencies into integrative technology-supported, community-based solutions. I will preview what's ahead for computational ecosystems, and close with a few thoughts on the role of computing technologies in advancing human values at scale.

 		<strong>Abstract:</strong>
 		<p style="padding-bottom:10px">
		In this talk we will present two current research projects from our Pen- and Touch Computing lab at Brown University.
		<br />
		<br />
		First, we will first demonstrate Vizdom (and it's processing backend IDEA) which are being developed in collaboration with Professor Tim Kraska's database management group and are sponsored by NSF and DARPA awards, as well as by gifts from Microsoft Research and Adobe. Vizdom is a pen- and touch-based interactive data exploration application with three salient features: 1) An emphasis on progressive computation that we argue (and to some degree tested in usability studies) greatly improves the user experience on larger datasets. 2) A tight integration of visualizations, machine learning and statistics all within the same tool and through an accessible interaction paradigm with the goal to empower "data-enthusiasts" - people who are not mathematicians or programmers, and only know a bit of statistics. 3) Embedding visual data exploration in a statistical framework to prevent common problems and statistical pitfalls (i.e., multiple comparisons problem).
		<br />
		<br />
		In the second part of our talk, we demonstrate, Dash, an early-stage prototype of an integrated environment for document-based knowledge work, enhanced with pen- and touch interactions; this work is sponsored by Microsoft Research and Adobe. With Dash we aim to streamline common knowledge worker tasks by allowing users to create, collect and relate heterogeneous documents in both structured and free-form workspaces. In contrast to most applications which have special purpose databases that aren't exposed as databases, Dash not only allows application-specific views but also exposes database views of its document and metadata information. This allows computational operators and data visualizations to be applied to any feature of the repository. Thus, with Dash, users create, as a byproduct of their natural workflow, custom "dashboards" on their data since Dash treats all searches, visualizations and layouts as first class interactive documents on par with all other documents.

 		<strong>Abstract:</strong>
 		<p style="padding-bottom:10px">
		Today's interfaces get closer and closer to our body and are now literally attached to it, e.g., wearable devices and virtual reality headsets. These provide a very direct and immersive interaction with virtual worlds. But what if, instead, these interfaces were a "part of our body"? In this talk I introduce the idea of an interactive system based on electrical muscle stimulation (EMS). EMS is a technique from medical rehabilitation in which a signal generator and electrodes attached to the user's skin are used to send electrical impulses that involuntarily contract the user's muscles. While EMS devices have been used to regenerate lost motor functions in rehabilitation medicine since the '60s, it has only been a few years since researchers started to explore EMS as a means for creating interactive systems. These more recent projects, including six of our projects, explore EMS as a means for teaching users new motor skills, increasing immersion in virtual experiences by simulating impact and walls in VR/AR, communicating with remote users and allowing users to read & write information using eyes-free wearable devices.

 		<strong>Abstract:</strong>
 		<p style="padding-bottom:10px">
		Implicit user interfaces obtain information from their users passively, typically in addition to mouse, keyboard, or other explicit inputs.  They fit into the emerging trends of physiological computing and affective computing.  Our work focuses on using brain input for this purpose, measured through functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), as a way of increasing the narrow communication bandwidth between human and computer.  Most previous brain-computer interfaces have been designed for people with severe motor disabilities and use explicit signals as the primary input; but these are too slow and inaccurate for wider use.  Instead, we use brain measurement to obtain more information about the user and their context directly and without asking additional effort from them.  We have obtained good results in a number of systems we created, as measured by objective task performance metrics.  I will discuss our work on brain-computer interfaces and the more general area of implicit interaction.

		I will also discuss our concept of Reality-Based Interaction (RBI) as a unifying framework that ties together a large subset of emerging new, non-WIMP user interfaces.  It attempts to connect current paths of research in HCI and to provide a framework that can be used to understand, compare, and relate these new developments.  Viewing them through the lens of RBI can provide insights for designers and allow us to find gaps or opportunities for future development.  I will briefly discuss some past work in my research group on a variety of next generation interfaces such as tangible interfaces and implicit eye movement-based interaction techniques.

 		<strong>Abstract:</strong>
 		<p style="padding-bottom:10px">
		ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) is a degenerative neuromuscular disease; people with late-stage ALS typically retain cognitive function, but lose the motor ability to speak, relying on gaze-controlled AAC (augmentative and alternative communication) devices for interpersonal interactions. State-of-the-art AAC technologies used by people with ALS do not facilitate natural communication; gaze-based AAC communication is extremely slow, and the resulting synthesized speech is flat and robotic. This lecture presents a series of novel technology prototypes from the Microsoft Research Enable team that aim to address the challenges of improving the expressivity of AAC for people with ALS.

 		<p style="padding-bottom:10px">

The goal of my research is to design, build, deploy, and evaluate novel computing systems that improve the lives of underserved populations in low-income regions. As computing technologies become affordable and accessible to diverse populations across the globe, it is critical that we expand the focus of HCI research to study the social, technical, and infrastructural challenges faced by these diverse communities and build systems that address problems in critical domains such as health care and education. In this talk, I describe my general approach to building technologies for underserved communities, including identifying opportunities for technology, conducting formative research to fully understand the space, developing novel technologies, iteratively testing and deploying, evaluating with target populations, and handing off to global development organizations for long-term sustainability.

 		<strong>Abstract:</strong>
 		<p style="padding-bottom:10px">

I will present work that leverages user behavioral data to build personalized applications, which I call "behavior-powered systems". Two applications use online user interactions: 1) WebGazer uses interaction data made on any website to continuously calibrate a webcam-based eye tracker, so that users can manipulate any web page solely by looking. 2) Drafty tracks interactions with a detailed table of computer science professors to ask the crowd of readers to help keep structured data up-to-date by inferring their interests. And two applications use mobile sensing data: 3) SleepCoacher uses smartphone sensors to capture noise and movement data while people sleep to automatically generate recommendations about how to sleep better through a continuous cycle of mini-experiments. 4) Rewind uses passive location tracking on smartphones to recreate a person‚Äôs past memory through a fusion of geolocation, street side imagery, and weather data. Together, these systems show how subtle footprints of user behavior collected remotely can reimagine the way we gaze at websites, improve our sleep, experience the past, and maintain changing data.

 		<strong>Abstract:</strong>
 		<p style="padding-bottom:10px">

Incredible advances in hardware have not been matched by equivalent advances in software; we remain mired in the graphical user interface of the 1970s. I argue that we need a paradigm shift in how we design, implement and use interactive systems. Classical artificial intelligence treats the human user as a cog in the computer's process -- the so-called ‚Äúhuman-in-the-loop‚Äù; Classical human-computer interaction focuses on creating and controlling the 'user experience'. We seek a third approach -- a true human-computer partnership, which takes advantage of machine learning, but leaves the user in control. I describe a series of projects that illustrate our approach to making interactive systems discoverable, appropriable and expressive, using the principles of instrumental interaction and reciprocal co-adaptation. 
The goal is to create robust interactive systems that significantly augment human capabilities and are actually worth learning over time.

 		<strong>Abstract:</strong>
 		<p style="padding-bottom:10px">

My group's research in Human-Computer Interaction focuses on design, prototyping and implementation tools for the era of ubiquitous embedded computing and digital fabrication. We focus especially on supporting the growing ranks of amateur designers and engineers in the Maker Movement. Over the past decade, a resurgence in interest how the artifacts in our world are designed, engineered and fabricated has led to new approaches for teaching art and engineering; new methods for creating artifacts for personal use; and new models for launching hardware products. The Maker Movement is enabled by a confluence of new technologies like digital fabrication and a sharing ethos built around online tutorials and open source design files. A crucial missing building block are appropriate design tools that enable Makers to translate their intent into appropriate machine instructions - whether code or 3D prints. Makers‚Äô expertise and work practices differ significantly from those of professional engineers - a reality that design tools have to reflect.
<BR><BR>
I will present research that enables Makers and designers to rapidly prototype, fabricate and program interactive products. Making headway in this area involves working in both hardware and software. Our group creates new physical fabrication hardware such as augmented power tools and custom CNC machines; new design software to make existing digital fabrication tools more useful; software platforms for the type of connected IoT devices many Makers are creating; and debugging tools for working at the intersection of hardware and software. We also create expertise sharing tools that lower the cost and increase the quality of online tutorials and videos through which knowledge is disseminated in this community.
<BR><BR>
Our work on these tools is motivated by the daily experience of teaching and building in the Jacobs Institute for Design Innovation - a 24,000 sq ft space for 21st-century design education that opened in 2015. I will give an overview of institute activities and projects, and how they inform our research agenda.

 		<strong>Abstract:</strong>
 		<p style="padding-bottom:10px">
For the past 15 years, I have been building robots that teach social and cognitive skills to children. Typically, we construct these robots to be social partners, to engage individuals with social skills that encourage that person to respond to the robot as a social agent rather than as a mechanical device. Most of the time, interactions with artificial agents (both robots and virtual characters) follow the same rules as interactions with people.
<BR><BR>
The first part of this talk will focus on how human-robot interactions are uniquely different from both human-agent interactions and human-human interactions. These differences, taken together, provide a case for why robots might be unique tools for learning.
<BR><BR>
The second part of this talk will describe some of our ongoing work on building robots that teach. In particular, I will describe some of the efforts to use robots to enhance the therapy and diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder.

 		<p style="padding-bottom:10px">
 			Sleep, stress and mental health have been major health issues in 
modern society. Poor sleep habits and high stress, as well as 
reactions to stressors and sleep habits, can depend on many factors. 
Internal factors include personality types and physiological factors 
and external factors include behavioral, environmental and social 
factors. What if 24/7 rich data from mobile devices could identify 
which factors influence your bad sleep or stress problem and provide 
personalized early warnings to help you change behaviors, before 
sliding from a good to a bad health condition such as depression?
<BR><BR>
In my talk, I will present a series of studies and systems we have 
developed to investigate how to leverage multi-modal data from 
mobile/wearable devices to measure, understand and improve mental 
wellbeing.

 			In this talk, I am going to present and demo our award winning research initiative on creating custom animations - Project Draco. Project Draco was recently released as Sketchbook Motion, and was featured by Apple as "The best iPad app of the year 2016".
			With Project Draco, we investigate the question of how we can enable everyone to bring life to otherwise static drawings‚Äîhow can we make animation as easy as sketching a static image?
			Most of us experience the power of animated media every day: animation makes it easy to communicate complex ideas beyond verbal language. However, only few of us have the skills to express ourselves through this medium. By making animation as easy, accessible, and fluid as sketching, I intend to make dynamic drawings a powerful medium to think, create, and communicate rapidly.
